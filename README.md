# Dbms
The Hospital Management System is a DBMS-based project designed to streamline the administrative and operational functions of a hospital. It provides an efficient way to manage patient records, doctor schedules, appointments, billing, and other hospital-related information.
The system uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and manage data securely and efficiently. The goal is to reduce manual workload, minimize errors, and provide quick access to critical information.
